# Nexus Resonance License (NRC-L) v1.3  
**Finalized February 06, 2026**

## Preamble

This License governs the **Nexus Resonance Codex (NRC)**, including all mathematical frameworks, proofs, code, visualizations, documentation, and derivative materials (collectively, **"NRC Materials"**), as presented in the document *NRC-Protein-Folding-Main-v2.0.3.tex* and related files (the **"Framework Document"**).

The NRC framework promotes resonant, truth-seeking innovation through the golden ratio inverse attractor (φ⁻¹ ≈ 0.6180339887) and modular exclusion principles. This license balances open collaboration with creator protection:

- **Non-commercial** use is free and encouraged to accelerate discovery  
- **Commercial** exploitation (including biotech applications) requires explicit agreement and royalty terms  
- **Harmful** applications are strictly prohibited

In good faith, the Licensor pledges not to assert intellectual property rights against compliant non-commercial, beneficial uses.

## 1. Definitions

- **NRC Materials** — Formulas (e.g., φ^{-1} attractor, 3-6-9-7 cycles), frameworks (GTT, QRT, MST, TUPT), proofs (Entropy Collapse Theorem), code, lattices (2048D E₈ projections), documents, and derivatives.  
- **Derivative Works** — Modifications, extensions, integrations, or applications of NRC Materials.  
- **Commercial Use** — Any monetization, profit generation, or business application.  
- **Biotech Applications** — Uses in biotechnology, pharmaceuticals, life sciences, drug discovery, or related fields.  
- **Harmful Use** — Applications involving weapons, surveillance, environmental damage, illegal activity, or detriment to humanity (determined reasonably by Licensor).  
- **Attribution** — Credit to "James Trageser (@jtrag)" with link to original source (e.g., viXra/arXiv/GitHub).  
- **Good Faith** — Use consistent with NRC’s resonant ethos: advancing knowledge without harm or unauthorized profit.

## 2. Good Faith Pledge

The Licensor (James Trageser) pledges not to enforce any intellectual property rights—including potential patents on NRC-derived applications—against any party using NRC Materials **in good faith** for non-commercial purposes, provided such use includes Attribution, avoids Harmful Use, and complies with this License.

This pledge fosters open exploration while reserving rights for commercial scenarios.

## 3. Non-Commercial Use (Open Grant)

Permission is granted, free of charge and royalty-free, to use, reproduce, modify, distribute, and create Derivative Works from NRC Materials **solely for non-commercial**, educational, research, or personal purposes.

**Conditions**:
- Include Attribution in all copies and Derivative Works  
- Distribute under this License (or compatible open license, e.g., CC-BY-NC-SA 4.0)  
- Avoid Harmful Use  
- Comply with good faith principles  

This grant supports infinite theoretical scaling (e.g., 256D → 2048D lattices), provided no profit is derived.

**Patent & Trademark Grant** (non-commercial only):  
Licensor grants a non-exclusive, royalty-free license to any patents embodied in NRC Materials and agrees not to assert trademarks against good-faith non-commercial uses.

## 4. Commercial Use & Royalties

Commercial Use is **prohibited** without prior **written permission** from the Licensor (James Trageser).

To request permission:  
Contact the Licensor to negotiate a separate commercial license agreement.  
Terms will include royalties (typically tiered and scaled reasonably, e.g., damped by φ^{-k} for derivative depth), upfront fees, milestones, and other conditions.

Royalties apply to any monetization of NRC Materials, in whole or in part (e.g., revenue attributable to 512D folding algorithms in a product).

Unauthorized Commercial Use voids all rights and may result in legal action, including damages equivalent to lost royalties.

## 5. Dual Licensing for Biotech Applications

NRC adopts a **dual licensing model** specifically for Biotech Applications:

**Non-Commercial Biotech Track**  
- Free for academic, clinical research, and educational use (Section 3 applies)  
- Requires Attribution and no profit generation

**Commercial Biotech Track**  
- Requires written agreement with the Licensor  
- Typical structure includes:  
  - Upfront fees  
  - Milestone payments (e.g., Phase I, Phase II, FDA approval)  
  - Tiered royalties on net sales (e.g., 5–15% range, commonly 3% $0–100M, 6% $100M–500M, 9% $500M–1B, 7% above — following 3-6-9-7 rhythm)  
- Exclusivity and cross-licensing of improvements negotiable

This model balances open scientific progress with fair compensation for commercial translation.

## 6. Indemnification

**Licensor Indemnity**  
Licensor shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensee from third-party claims alleging direct IP infringement by unmodified NRC Materials (as provided), up to the amount of royalties actually paid (if commercial). Excludes claims arising from Licensee modifications or misuse.

**Licensee Indemnity**  
Licensee shall indemnify, defend, and hold harmless Licensor from all claims arising from Licensee’s use, including Harmful Use, Derivative Works, breaches, or negligence.

**Mutual**  
Each party indemnifies the other for willful misconduct or gross negligence. No indemnity for indirect, consequential, or punitive damages.

**Procedure**  
Prompt written notice of claim required. Indemnified party cooperates fully; indemnifying party controls defense and settlement (no settlement admitting liability without consent).

## 7. Prohibitions & Protections

- **Harmful Use** — Strictly prohibited. Any such use immediately terminates all rights and may result in liability.  
- **Misuse** — NRC Materials may not be used to infringe third-party rights, promote harm, or act unethically. Licensor reserves revocation rights for violations.  
- **Export & Compliance** — Users must comply with all applicable laws (export controls, ITAR/EAR for dual-use tech, GDPR for biotech data, etc.).  
- **Moral Rights** — Licensor waives moral rights claims for non-commercial uses; reserves for commercial.  
- **Force Majeure** — Neither party liable for delays due to uncontrollable events (pandemics, natural disasters, war, etc.).

## 8. No Warranty / Disclaimer of Liability

NRC Materials are provided **"as is"**, without any warranties—express, implied, statutory, or otherwise—including but not limited to warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, or non-infringement.

Licensor disclaims all liability for any damages arising from use, including direct, indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages—even if advised of the possibility.

Users assume all risk and must independently verify results (e.g., via code execution, symbolic proofs, simulations).

## 9. Termination

Any breach (unauthorized Commercial Use, Harmful Use, failure to provide Attribution, etc.) automatically terminates all rights granted under this License.

Upon termination, Licensee must immediately cease all use and destroy all copies of NRC Materials.

Surviving provisions: Sections 4 (royalties), 6 (indemnification), 7 (prohibitions), 8 (disclaimer), and 10 (governing law).

## 10. Governing Law & Dispute Resolution

Governed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, USA (without regard to conflict of laws principles), and the laws of the United States of America.

Disputes shall be resolved through binding arbitration in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and/or Washington D.C., following a modular 3-6-9 step fairness process. Judgment on the award may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction.

If any provision is held invalid, the remainder shall continue in full force.

## 11. Updates & Contact

Licensor may update this License (notification via @jtrag on X or repository). Continued use constitutes acceptance.
